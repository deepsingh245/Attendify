# Attendify
<p>A Smart attendance system using face recognition</p>
<p>In this app we have an attendance system using face API's face detection and recognition.</p>
<p>Here we will add our students data in the labels folder and with their name on the folder and 2 pics inside it naming 1.jpg and 2.jpg respectively.</p>
then just open the html page with live serever and here we have our own recpgnition system.
<p>This system will automatically recognize the faces and generate an excel sheet with marked attendance of students who were present in it.</p>
<p>Here is the demo pics</p>
